## Conclusion
In summary, we found several predictors that were influential to a movieâ€™s success in the
box office. IMDb rating was shown to have a positive correlation on the effect of movie revenue.
We saw that larger movie budgets corresponded to better box office revenue. The number of
screenings was also a factor in box office success. However, social media statistics such as
YouTube views, likes, and dislikes were not strong indicators of box office success or failure,
and movies with large social media followings had moderate correlation with box office success.
